# Giphy API

## Description
This was our first homework scraping an API to return data to our page using AJAX call. The minimum requirements of the game are listed below:
* Have a start screen that has a title, entry field, buttons
* Buttons when clicked will display gifs on page for that specific button
* Entry field, enter a new gif topic, when submitted button will be created
* New button will pull from giphy API and display gifs on page
* When clicking button, all other gifs are wiped and new gifs are placed 
* Gifs start in still state, when clicked on they animate, click again returns state to still
* Limit results to 10

The exercise had us manipulate:
* APIs / AJAX call
* jQuery
* Functions
* DOM
* Arrays
* Debugging

## Roadmap
Intend to improve the styling to make the page more visually appealing

## Feedback
Open to feedback and how to finish the logic, restructure code.
